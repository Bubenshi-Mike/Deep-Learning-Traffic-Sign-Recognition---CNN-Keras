# Deep-Learning-Traffic-Sign-Recognition---CNN-Keras
Deep Learning is part of the broader family of Machine Learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Its architectures such as Deep Neural Networks, Deep Belief Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks have been applied to fields including Computer Vision, speech recognition, bio-informatics, image and audio recognition, social Network filtering and many other where they have produced results comparable to and in some ways surpassing human expert performance. The system to be developed will use the Convolutional Neural Network to recognize and classify Traffic signs.
